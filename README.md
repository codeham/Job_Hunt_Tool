## Job Hunt

### What is Job Hunt ?
  Why is it so hard to keep track of every place you've applied to when you begin your employment journey ?
  Of course there are many amazing search engines that query and cater to your exact specifications, but wouldn't it be nice
  to have all this data organized in one centralized repository at your disposal ?
  
  Job Hunt removes the pain in remembering exact descriptions and qualifications of jobs applied to by storing entries in a centralized database, and also allows you to keep track of the current status of your applied job.
