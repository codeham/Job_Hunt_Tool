# Job Hunt
### :grin: (work in progress...) 

## What is Job Hunt ?
  Why is it so hard to keep track of every place you've applied to when you begin your employment journey ?
  Of course there are many amazing search engines that query and cater to your exact specifications, but wouldn't it be nice
  to have all this data organized in one centralized repository at your disposal ?
  
  Job Hunt removes the pain in remembering exact descriptions and qualifications of jobs applied to by storing entries in a centralized database, and also allows you to keep track of the current status of your applied job.

###  Job Hunt aims to do the following
   * Keeps track of job listings in a centralized repository with a user friendly UI.
   * Provide multiple user-facing features such as searching by multiple attributes & 
   	 in-depth visual data analytics (Ex. Which cities do I hear back from the most?)
   * Easily keep track of multiple job applications without the hassle of searching 
     through  excel sheets and old emails.

### Future Features
   * Exporting entries in PDF format
   * Visual data analytics utilizing Graph.js
   * One-click autofill posting from job listing source
